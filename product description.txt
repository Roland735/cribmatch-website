Expanded site description — CribMatch Zimbabwe (real-estate focused)

CribMatch Zimbabwe is a fast, human-first rental assistant that connects renters, landlords and agents across Zimbabwe using two interfaces: the web and WhatsApp. Use the website to browse listings, understand the process, and shortlist options. Use WhatsApp for concierge matching, availability checks, viewing coordination, and basic verification steps.

Tailwind color palette (suitable for a real-estate agent company)

Below is a compact, trustworthy palette — professional but warm and local-friendly. I include HEXs and how to add them to your tailwind.config.js as custom colors, plus example usage.

// tailwind.config.js (extend colors)
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: {
          DEFAULT: '#0B5E5A', // deep teal - brand primary (trustworthy, calm)
          50: '#E7F6F5',
          100: '#CFECEB',
          200: '#9FDDD7',
          300: '#6FCDBF',
          400: '#3FBCA7',
          500: '#0B5E5A'
        },
        accent: {
          DEFAULT: '#F59E0B', // warm gold - call to action, highlights
          100: '#FFF3DB',
          200: '#FFE8A8',
          300: '#FFD475',
          400: '#F59E0B'
        },
        neutral: {
          900: '#0F1724', // near-black for headings
          700: '#334155', // body text
          500: '#64748B', // muted text
          300: '#CBD5E1', // border / alt bg
          100: '#F1F5F9'  // page background
        },
        success: '#16A34A',
        danger: '#DC2626',
        mutedBlue: '#1E3A8A' // optional accent for links or badges
      }
    }
  }
}

Example Tailwind usage (practical)

Hero background: bg-neutral-100

Primary button: bg-primary text-white hover:bg-primary/90 (or bg-primary-500)

Secondary button: bg-white border border-primary text-primary

Accent elements (badges, price tags): bg-accent text-neutral-900

Card background: bg-white shadow-md rounded-2xl p-6 with border border-neutral-300

Headings: text-neutral-900 font-semibold text-2xl

Body text: text-neutral-700

Footer: bg-primary text-white (or inverted bg-neutral-900 text-neutral-100)

Why this palette works for real estate

Deep teal (primary) feels trustworthy, modern and distinct from common blues used by competitors.

Warm gold (accent) draws attention to CTAs like “Chat on WhatsApp” or “Featured”.

Neutral greys keep the UI clean and let listing photos stand out.

Quick accessibility & design tips

Ensure contrast ratio between text and background meets WCAG AA (use dark text on light backgrounds or light text on dark backgrounds).

Buttons must be at least 44px high on mobile for tappability (py-2 px-4 rounded-lg).

Use plenty of white space around listing images and CTAs — mobile-first layout.
